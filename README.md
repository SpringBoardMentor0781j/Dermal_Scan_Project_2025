DermalScan: AI-Powered Facial Skin Aging Classifier and Age Predictor
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the DermalScan project, covering its purpose, features, and instructions for both end-users and developers.
________________________________________
üìå Project Overview
DermalScan is a deep learning-based system designed to detect and classify facial aging signs (wrinkles, dark spots, puffy eyes) and predict a person's apparent age  from an image.
The project leverages two distinct models:
‚Ä¢	ResNet50V2‚Üí Classifier for identifying signs of aging. 
‚Ä¢	MobileNetV2 ‚Üí Performs dual task of age regression. 
The backend integrates:
‚Ä¢	Face detection (Haar Cascades) 
‚Ä¢	Image preprocessing 
‚Ä¢	Model inference 
A user-friendly Streamlit web application serves as the frontend, allowing users to upload images and view annotated results.

‚ú® Features
‚Ä¢	Face Detection ‚Üí Automatically detects and localizes human faces in an uploaded image.
‚Ä¢	Aging Sign Classification ‚Üí Classifies detected faces into four categories:
o	Clear Face
o	Dark Spots
o	Puffy Eyes
o	Wrinkles
(with confidence scores for each)
‚Ä¢	Age Prediction ‚Üí Predicts apparent age (integer).
‚Ä¢	Annotated Image Generation ‚Üí Creates annotated images with bounding boxes and predictions.
‚Ä¢	Data Export ‚Üí Download annotated images and a CSV file with detailed predictions.
‚Ä¢	Web Interface ‚Üí Simple, intuitive UI for uploads and results.

üîé How It Works
1.	Upload an image through the web interface.
2.	Haar Cascade detects the face location.
3.	The detected face is cropped and preprocessed.
4.	ResNet50V2 ‚Üí classifies aging signs.
5.	MobileNetV2 ‚Üí predicts age.
6.	The original image is annotated with predictions.
7.	Results displayed on the results page (with options to download).
üåê How to Use the Web App
1.	Open the web app in your browser.
2.	Click "Choose an Image" ‚Üí upload .jpg, .jpeg, or .png.
3.	Use a clear, well-lit face image for best results.
4.	Click "Analyze Image".
5.	View the results: original + annotated image, predictions, confidence scores.
6.	Download annotated image or CSV report.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
1. Prerequisites
‚Ä¢	Python 3.8+
‚Ä¢	pip
2. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DermalScan.git
cd DermalScan
3. Create Virtual Environment
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

________________________________________üî¨ Replicating Model Training
To replicate the training process for the models used in this project, follow the instructions below.
1. Skin Condition Classifier (ResNet50V2)
‚Ä¢	Training Script: main.py
‚Ä¢	Setup: Download the custom dataset for skin conditions and ensure the DATASET_PATH variable in the script points to its location.
‚Ä¢	Process: The script handles data preprocessing, augmentation, transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet50V2, and fine-tuning.
2. Age Predictor (MobileNetV2)
‚Ä¢	Training Script: train_age_model.py
‚Ä¢	Setup: Download the UTKFace dataset and ensure the DATASET_PATH variable in the script points to its location.
‚Ä¢	Process: The script handles label parsing from filenames, preprocessing of 128√ó128 RGB images, and model training for the regression task.
